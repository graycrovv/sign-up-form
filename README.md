# Form Sign-Up Practice Project (The Odin Project)
Welcome to the Form Sign-Up Practice project, a part of The Odin Project curriculum! 
This project showcases my ability to create user interfaces, implement effective form validation, and develop responsive web applications.
## Project Overview
This project is a dedicated part of The Odin Project, reflecting my progress and accomplishments within the curriculum. 
While not intended as a comprehensive guide for others, this project can 
inspire fellow developers and serve as an authentic representation of my capabilities.

Engage with the form validation by completing the form fields. 
Experiment with various scenarios, such as submitting empty fields or using incorrect email formats.
Experience the responsive design by resizing the browser window or accessing the page on different devices.
## Technologies Used
HTML5 and Sass/CSS3: Employed for the structure and style of the form sign-up page.

JavaScript: Utilized to provide form validation and enhance user interaction.
